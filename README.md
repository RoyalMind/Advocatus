Advocatus focuses on three main areas:

* **Stability**: Waterfall aims to be stable. We will achieve this through making the code base testable and discouraging practices that lead to proxy lag.
* **Features**: Waterfall aims to include more features than canonical BungeeCord.
* **Scalability**: Waterfall should be able to handle a large number of concurrent players, given a reasonably modern CPU, memory, and good network connection.
* **Usability**: Advocatus focuses its efforts on providing interfaces that are user-friendly.
* **Performance**: Advocatus offers full integration with containers for a more effective CI/CD workflow.

## Why fork Waterfall?

Advocatus has a goal of adding additional protocol versions.

Advocatus will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
